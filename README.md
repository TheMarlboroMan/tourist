Small project about "visiting" some city

# what was this?

After visiting Japan I became enraptured with how much did it have to offer and
how cleanly the transport system was setup. This project would have generated a 
city and asked the user to move through it balancing two resources (money and
time). The different locations would have had different impacts in some stats
(hunger, calm, culture, fun) and the whole program would have revolved around
taking decisions on where to go.

# archiving

As of September 2022 this repository will be archived and worked on no longer.
The idea did not survive long.
